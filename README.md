# Coding Quiz

This is a quick JavaScript-based quiz game to test the player's coding knowledge. It creates elements with JavaScript and allows users to save high scores to localStorage as well as display them on a local leaderboard.

## Roadmap

## Contributing

A helpful feature is that the rest of the code doesn't need to be changed at all as more questions are added - only the answers and questions arrays. Adding additional questions is thus very simple. Any input and additional quiz questions are appreciated via opening issues on Github.
